# Astrosaurus ðŸ¦•

Astrosaurus is a documentation & blog & simple home page tool for alternative to [Vitepress](https://github.com/) and [Docusaurus](https://github.com/).

Astrosaurus could be a perfect fit for a project that searchs a fast documentation website. As Astro itself is king in static website generation.

### Features

- Astro itself
- Framework agnostic: we use no renderer as React, Vue or Svelte under the hood.
- autogenerated sidebar

### Roadmap

- i18n support / smoother integration with the astro integration library.
