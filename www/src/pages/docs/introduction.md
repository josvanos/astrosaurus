Astrosaurus is a documentation & blog & simple home page tool for alternative to [Vitepress](https://github.com/) and [Docusaurus](https://github.com/).

Astrosaurus could be a perfect fit for a project that searchs a fast documentation website. As Astro itself is king in static website generation.
